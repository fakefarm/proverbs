  <p>Proverbs is a book of guidance for parents to teach their children. Memorizing proverbs gives your child a moral compass and respect for life. Proverbs admonishes children to avoid fools and pursue wisdom.</p>
  <p>Proverbs is a great topic of conversation in the car, at bed, and over meal time. You will be encouraged and inspired by their ability to memorize by simple repetition. As a bonus, you will end up memorizing it too!</p>
  <b>a little background...</b>
  <p> I started leading the boys to memorize proverbs because I got tired of talking about ninja turtles and laser sharks that are more powerful than volcano tornadoes. But the other reason is that proverbs is highly postured toward a parent instructing their child. "Listen my son to your Father's instruction." If you take that literally, then Proverbs is for parents with toddlers.</p>
